üìå Objective

The objective of Task 8 is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze the dataset, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance. This task demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

üìÇ Dataset

Source: (Mention dataset link or source if given in your internship task)

Description: The dataset contains [briefly describe features/columns].

Target Variable: [Specify target/output column].

‚öôÔ∏è Steps / Methodology

Data Collection & Import

Loaded dataset using Python (Pandas).

Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values.

Performed data cleaning and transformations.

Encoded categorical variables (if any).

Normalized/standardized numerical values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions.

Checked correlations between features and target.

Model Building

Implemented multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Compared model performances.
